Render each of the three documents. How do the outputs differ? How do the inputs differ? (You may need to install LaTeX in order to build the PDF output --- RStudio will prompt you if this is necessary.)**\n\nThe outputs are different in the following ways:\\--\n\n-   The output text and code are same, but rendering to PDF takes more time than Word. HTML rendering seems to be the fastest.\n\n-   PDF and MS Word cannot incorporate interactive graphics, while HTML offers interactivity.\n\n-   The size of the PDF document is the largest, followed by MS Word document, while the HTML uses the least disk space.\n\n# 29.3.1 Exercises\n\n1.  **Re-create the document in [Figure 29.5](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/quarto.html#fig-visual-editor) using the visual editor.**\n\nText Formatting\n\n*italic* **bold** underline ~~strikeout~~ [small caps]{.smallcaps} `code` superscript^2^ and subscript~2~\n\n### Headings\n\n# 1st Level Header\n\n## 2nd Level Header\n\n### 3rd Level Header\n\n## Lists\n\n-   Bulleted list item 1\n\n-   Item 2\n\n    -   Item 2a\n\n    -   Item 2b\n\n1.

Render the document and observe how the reference shows up in the document. What change do you observe in the YAML of your document?**\n\n[^1]: This is a sample footnote to answer the Question 3(a) of the 29.3.1 Exercises within the Chapter 29 \"Quarto\" of the Book \"[R for Data Science, 2nd Edition](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/ \"R for Data Science (2e)\")\" by Wickham, Cetinkaya-Rundel & Grolemund.\n\n[^2]: Source: [Scribbr.com](https://www.scribbr.com/frequently-asked-questions/what-is-a-block-quote/ \"FAQs at scribbr.com\"). What is a block quote?\n\nLet us first add some text from the paper, so that we can use a citation:\\-\\--\n\n> At a high level, the tidyverse is a language for solving data science challenges with R code.

[@wickham2019]\n\nOnce we render the document, the citation shows up in the very end of the HTML webpage rendered. It is displayed just above the footnotes. The YAML header of the document, when viewed in the \"Source\" displays an additional line `bibliography: references.bib`.\n\n# 29.4.1 Exercises\n\n1.  **Practice what you've learned by creating a brief CV. The title should be your name, and you should include headings for (at least) education or employment. Each of the sections should include a bulleted list of jobs/degrees. Highlight the year in bold.**\n\n    #### Aditya Dahiya\n\n    -   Education\n\n        -   **2005 - 2010:** Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (M.B.B.S.), All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi\n\n        -   **2011-2013:** Master of Arts (Public Policy), Indira Gandhi National Open University\n\n        -   **2021-22:** Master of Public Health, Harvard University, U.S.A.\n\n    -   Employment\n\n        -   **2010-2011:** Junior Resident Doctor, Neuro-Radiology, A.I.I.M.S., New Delhi\n\n        -   **2011-to date:** Indian Administrative Services, Government of India\n\n2.  **Using the source editor and the Markdown quick reference, figure out how to:**\n\n    a.  **Add a footnote.**\n\n        To begin with we add a footnote here.[^3] Then, we inspect the `Source` tab and find that the method to create a footnote in source editor is to use `[^x]`, where `x` represents the footnote number. Further, I could not find the `footnote` option in **Markdown Quick Reference** though **Help** menu in the RStudio. But, I searched online and found from [here](https://crimebythenumbers.com/r-markdown.html \"Crime by the Numbers: A Criminologist’s Guide to R by Jacob Kaplan\") that \"*to create a footnote in R Markdown, you use the carrot \\^ followed immediately by square brackets \\[\\]. Put the text inside of the \\[\\] and it'll print that at the bottom of the page.* *Code for a footnote will look like this: \\^\\[This sentence will be printed as a footnote.\\] .* So, I try it here again. [^4]\n\n    b.  **Add a horizontal rule.**\n\n        The easiest way to add a horizontal rule in the source editor is \"\\-\\--\", i.e. three hyphens. Or, in the **Visual** editor, we can choose **Insert** -\\> **Horizontal Rule**.\n\n        ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    c.  **Add a block quote.**\n\n        A block quote can be added in the source editor by using a tab, followed by `>` key, followed by the text. Further, the book, [R Markdown: The Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/tufte-quotes.html \"R Markdown: The Definitive Guide by Yihui Xie, J. J. Allaire, Garrett Grolemund\"), tells us that *\"paragraphs that start with* `>` *are converted to block quotes.\"*\n\n3.  **Copy and paste the contents of `diamond-sizes.qmd` from <https://github.com/hadley/r4ds/tree/main/quarto> in to a local R Quarto document. Check that you can run it, then add text after the frequency polygon that describes its most striking features.**\n\n[^3]: I use Ctrl + Shift + 7 to create a footnote here.\n\n[^4]: This is a test footnote I wrote in the Source Editor\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have data about 53940 diamonds. Only 126 are larger than 2.5 carats. The distribution of the remainder is shown below:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Chapter29_files/figure-html/plot-smaller-diamonds-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Here's the paragraph:** The frequency polygon tells us that the carat distribution peaks at increments of 0.1, reflecting the fact the measurements of `carat` is done in increments of 0.1. Further, there are fewer diamonds of higher `carat` size.\n\n4.  **Create a document in a Google doc or MS Word (or locate a document you have created previously) with some content in it such as headings, hyperlinks, formatted text, etc. Copy the contents of this document and paste it into a Quarto document in the visual editor. Then, switch over to the source editor and inspect the source code.**\n\nThis is sample MS Word Document. I will copy this document into **Visual Editor** of Quarto, and then see the code entered in the **Source Editor**.\n\n-   **First, here's a list of 4 largest continents:**\n\n    (i) Asia\n    (ii) Africa\n    (iii) North America\n    (iv) South America\n    (v) Europe\n    (vi) Oceania\n    (vii) Antarctica\n\n-   **Second, here's a list of largest oceans**\n\n    1.  Pacific Ocean\n    2.  Atlantic Ocean\n    3.  Indian Ocean\n    4.  Arctic Ocean\n    5.  Southern Ocean\n\nThe text can be **bold,** *iltalic,* or, it can be [underlined.]{.underline}\n\nI observe that The **Source Editor** automatically inserts the R Markdown code needed to produce the visual output of MS Word. The **Visual Editor** displays the text, just like MS Word. Of course, there are some bugs, especially in bulletined lists and numbered lists with indents. I am unable to create copy the format of sub-lists within bullet points into the **Visual Editor**. So, I manually went to the **Source Editor,** and inserted two `tabs` before each sub-list point. But, for retaining the formatting of **bold,** *italics* or underline, the Visual Editor of Quarto is pretty awesome!\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1+3 / 4\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 1.75\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# **29.5.5 Exercises**\n\n1.  **Add a section that explores how diamond sizes vary by cut, color, and clarity. Assume you're writing a report for someone who doesn't know R, and instead of setting `echo: false` on each chunk, set a global option.**\n\nLet's explore the `diamonds` data-set. There are 53,940 diamonds in the data-set. We create histograms for `color`, `cut` and `clarity`. These three help us explore the distribution of diamonds among different types of `color`, `cut` and `clarity`. To not display the code, I use `#|echo: false` at the start of the chunk. Alternatively, I could use the following code in the YAML header:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nknitr: \n  opts_chunk: \n    collapse: true\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnrow(diamonds)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 53940\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ng1 = ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(y = cut)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"count\") +\n  theme_classic() +\n  labs(x = NULL, y = \"Cut\")\ng2 = ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(y = color,\n                                      fill = color,\n                                      color = color)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"count\") +\n  theme_classic() +\n  labs(x = NULL, y = \"Color\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"null\")\ng3 = ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(y = clarity)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"count\") +\n  theme_classic() +\n  labs(x = \"Number of Diamonds\", y = \"Clarity\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"null\")\nlibrary(patchwork)\np = g1 / g2 / g3 + plot_layout(ncol = 1)\nprint(p)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Chapter29_files/figure-html/ggplot2-example-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n2.  **Download `diamond-sizes.qmd` from <https://github.com/hadley/r4ds/tree/main/quarto>.
