Read the instructions. Practice running the chunks individually. Then render the document by clicking the appropriate button and then by using the appropriate keyboard short cut. Verify that you can modify the code, re-run it, and see modified output.**\n\n-   The document has been created.\n\n-   Some of the chunks are as follows:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\ndiamonds |> \n  filter(carat > 2) |>\n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x=carat, y=price,\n                       color = color)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + \n  #scale_y_continuous(trans = \"log\") +\n  geom_smooth(se=FALSE) + \n  scale_color_brewer(palette = 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Chapter29_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n-   Verifying that the code can be modified and re-run:--\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\ndiamonds |> \n  filter(carat > 2) |>\n  filter (carat < 3) |>\n  filter (price > 10000) |>\n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x=carat, y=price,\n                       color = color)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) + \n  scale_y_continuous(trans = \"log\") +\n  geom_smooth(se=FALSE) + \n  scale_color_brewer(palette = 4) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Plot of relation between Carat and Price\",\n       subtitle = \"For different colours of diamonds\",\n       y = \"Price (in $)\", x = \"Carat\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Chapter29_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n2.  **Create one new Quarto document for each of the three built-in formats: HTML, PDF and Word. Render each of the three documents. How do the outputs differ? How do the inputs differ? (You may need to install LaTeX in order to build the PDF output --- RStudio will prompt you if this is necessary.)**\n\nThe outputs are different in the following ways:\\--\n\n-   The output text and code are same, but rendering to PDF takes more time than Word. HTML rendering seems to be the fastest.\n\n-   PDF and MS Word cannot incorporate interactive graphics, while HTML offers interactivity.\n\n-   The size of the PDF document is the largest, followed by MS Word document, while the HTML uses the least disk space.\n\n### 29.3.1 Exercises\n\n1.  **Re-create the document in [Figure 29.5](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/quarto.html#fig-visual-editor) using the visual editor.**\n\nText Formatting\n\n*italic* **bold** underline ~~strikeout~~ [small caps]{.smallcaps} `code` superscript^2^ and subscript~2~\n\n### Headings\n\n# 1st Level Header\n\n## 2nd Level Header\n\n### 3rd Level Header\n\n## Lists\n\n-   Bulleted list item 1\n\n-   Item 2\n\n    -   Item 2a\n\n    -   Item 2b\n\n1.  Numbered list item 1\n\n2.  Item 2. The numbers are incremented automatically in the output.\n\n### Links and Images\n\n<https://example.com/>\n\n[linked phrases](https://www.oxfordinternationalenglish.com/linking-words-and-phrases-in-english/ \"Oxford English Dictionary meaning of Linked Phrases\")\n\n[![Credits: Nick Tierney's (mostly) rstats blog](https://www.njtierney.com/post/2022/04/11/rmd-to-qmd/imgs/r-knitr-rmd.jpeg){fig-alt=\"Notes on Changing from Rmarkdown/Bookdown to Quarto\" width=\"338\"}](https://www.njtierney.com/post/2022/04/11/rmd-to-qmd/)\n\nTables\n\n| First Header     | Second Header    |\n|------------------|------------------|\n| Content Cell 1.1 | Content Cell 2.1 |\n| Content Cell 1.2 | Content Cell 2.2 |\n| Content Cell 1.3 | Content Cell 2.3 |\n\n: My First Table in Quarto\n\n2.  **Using the visual editor, insert a code chunk using the Insert menu and then the insert anything tool.**\n\n    Here, I am inserting a code chunk using simple the \"/\" key, and then selecting R-code option:\\--\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    print(\"Hello World\")\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n    ```\n    [1] \"Hello World\"\n    ```\n    :::\n    :::\n\n\n3.  **Using the visual editor, figure out how to:**\n\n    a.  **Add a footnote.**\n\n        You can add a foot note by selecting the menu **Insert** --\\> **Footnote**; or, by using **Ctrl+Shift+7**. Here is an example.[^1]\n\n    b.  **Add a horizontal rule.**\n\n        You can add a foot note by selecting the menu **Insert** --\\> **Horizontal Rule**. Here is an example:\\--\n\n        ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    c.  **Add a block quote.**\n\n        You can add a foot note by selecting the menu **Format** --\\> **Block quote**. Here is how we add a block quote:-\n\n        > A block quote is a long quote formatted as a separate \"block\" of text. Instead of using quotation marks, you place the quote on a new line, and indent the entire quote to mark it apart from your own words[^2]\n\n4.  **In the visual editor, go to Insert \\> Citation and insert a citation to the paper titled [Welcome to the Tidyverse](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.01686) using its DOI (digital object identifier), which is [10.21105/joss.01686](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.01686). Render the document and observe how the reference shows up in the document. What change do you observe in the YAML of your document?**\n\n[^1]: This is a sample footnote to answer the Question 3(a) of the 29.3.1 Exercises within the Chapter 29 \"Quarto\" of the Book \"[R for Data Science, 2nd Edition](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/ \"R for Data Science (2e)\")\" by Wickham, Cetinkaya-Rundel & Grolemund.\n\n[^2]: Source: [Scribbr.com](https://www.scribbr.com/frequently-asked-questions/what-is-a-block-quote/ \"FAQs at scribbr.com\"). What is a block quote?\n\nLet us first add some text from the paper, so that we can use a citation:\\-\\--\n\n> At a high level, the tidyverse is a language for solving data science challenges with R code. Its primary goal is to facilitate a conversation between a human and a computer about data. Less abstractly, the tidyverse is a collection of R packages that share a high-level design philosophy and low-level grammar and data structures, so that learning one package makes it easier to learn the next. [@wickham2019]\n\nOnce we render the document, the citation shows up in the very end of the HTML webpage rendered. It is displayed just above the footnotes. The YAML header of the document, when viewed in the \"Source\" displays an additional line `bibliography: references.bib`.\n\n### 29.4.1 Exercises\n\n1.  **Practice what you've learned by creating a brief CV. The title should be your name, and you should include headings for (at least) education or employment. Each of the sections should include a bulleted list of jobs/degrees. Highlight the year in bold.**\n\n2.  Using the source editor and the Markdown quick reference, figure out how to:\n\n    a.  Add a footnote.\n\n    b.  Add a horizontal rule.\n\n    c.  Add a block quote.\n\n3.  Copy and paste the contents of `diamond-sizes.qmd` from <https://github.com/hadley/r4ds/tree/main/quarto> in to a local R Quarto document. Check that you can run it, then add text after the frequency polygon that describes its most striking features.\n\n4.  Create a document in a Google doc or MS Word (or locate a document you have created previously) with some content in it such as headings, hyperlinks, formatted text, etc. Copy the contents of this document and paste it into a Quarto document in the visual editor. Then, switch over to the source editor and inspect the source code.\n",
