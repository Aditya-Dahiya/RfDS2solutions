### Some important t**ips:**

-   Use `Alt + -` to write the assignment operator `<-` in `R`.

-   In the comments, i.e, text written after `#` in code, explain the **WHY** of your code, not the **WHAT** or **HOW**.

# **3.5 Exercises**

1.  **Why does this code not work?**

    ```         
    my_variable <- 10 
    my_varıable 
    #> Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'my_varıable' not found
    ```

    Look carefully! (This may seem like an exercise in pointlessness, but training your brain to notice even the tiniest difference will pay off when programming.)

    The code does not work because of the minor spelling difference, i.e., `i` vs. `ī` .

2.  **Tweak each of the following R commands so that they run correctly:**

    ```         
    libary(todyverse)  
    ggplot(dTA = mpg) +    
      geom_point(maping = aes(x = displ y = hwy)) +   
      geom_smooth(method = "lm)
    ```

    The corrected code is as follows:\-\--

    ```{r}
    #| label: q2-corrected code
    #| eval: false

    library(tidyverse)  
    ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +    
      geom_point() +   
      geom_smooth(method = "lm")

    ```

3.  **Press Option + Shift + K / Alt + Shift + K. What happens? How can you get to the same place using the menus?**

    The `Alt + Shift + K` shortcut brings up the **Keyboard Shortcut Quick Reference**. We could get to the same using menus as **Help** --\> **Keyboard Shortcuts Help**.

4.  **Let's revisit an exercise from the [Section 2.6](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-visualize.html#sec-ggsave). Run the following lines of code. Which of the two plots is saved as `mpg-plot.png`? Why?**

    ```         
    my_bar_plot <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = class)) +   
      geom_bar() 

    my_scatter_plot <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
      geom_point() 

    ggsave(filename = "mpg-plot.png", plot = my_bar_plot)
    ```

    This time, the bar plot, i.e. `my_bar_plot` is saved into the file `mpg-plot.png` because in the arguments to the function `ggsave()` we have specified the name of the plot. The plot argument tells `ggsave()` the Plot to save, and by default, it goes to the last plot displayed.
