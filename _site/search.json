Then render the document by clicking the appropriate button and then by using the appropriate keyboard short cut. Verify that you can modify the code, re-run it, and see modified output.\n\n\nThe document has been created.\nSome of the chunks are as follows:\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\ndiamonds |&gt; \n  filter(carat &gt; 2) |&gt;\n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x=carat, y=price,\n                       color = color)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + \n  #scale_y_continuous(trans = \"log\") +\n  geom_smooth(se=FALSE) + \n  scale_color_brewer(palette = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\nVerifying that the code can be modified and re-run:–\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\ndiamonds |&gt; \n  filter(carat &gt; 2) |&gt;\n  filter (carat &lt; 3) |&gt;\n  filter (price &gt; 10000) |&gt;\n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x=carat, y=price,\n                       color = color)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) + \n  scale_y_continuous(trans = \"log\") +\n  geom_smooth(se=FALSE) + \n  scale_color_brewer(palette = 4) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Plot of relation between Carat and Price\",\n       subtitle = \"For different colours of diamonds\",\n       y = \"Price (in $)\", x = \"Carat\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate one new Quarto document for each of the three built-in formats: HTML, PDF and Word. Render each of the three documents. How do the outputs differ? How do the inputs differ? (You may need to install LaTeX in order to build the PDF output — RStudio will prompt you if this is necessary.)\n\nThe outputs are different in the following ways:--\n\nThe output text and code are same, but rendering to PDF takes more time than Word. HTML rendering seems to be the fastest.\nPDF and MS Word cannot incorporate interactive graphics, while HTML offers interactivity.\nThe size of the PDF document is the largest, followed by MS Word document, while the HTML uses the least disk space."

Render the document and observe how the reference shows up in the document. What change do you observe in the YAML of your document?\n\nLet us first add some text from the paper, so that we can use a citation:---\n\nAt a high level, the tidyverse is a language for solving data science challenges with R code. Its primary goal is to facilitate a conversation between a human and a computer about data. Less abstractly, the tidyverse is a collection of R packages that share a high-level design philosophy and low-level grammar and data structures, so that learning one package makes it easier to learn the next. (Wickham et al. 2019)\n\nOnce we render the document, the citation shows up in the very end of the HTML webpage rendered. It is displayed just above the footnotes. The YAML header of the document, when viewed in the “Source” displays an additional line bibliography: references.bib."
