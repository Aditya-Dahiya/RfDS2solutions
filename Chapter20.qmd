# **20.2.4 Exercises**

## Question 1

**We forgot to draw the relationship between `weather` and `airports` in [Figure 20.1](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/joins#fig-flights-relationships). What is the relationship and how should it appear in the diagram?**

The relation between `weather` and `airports` is depicted below in the image adapted and copied from [R for Data Science 2(e)](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/joins#fig-flights-relationships), [Fig 20.1](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/diagrams/relational.png).

-   The primary key will be `airports$faa` .

-   It corresponds to a compound secondary key, `weather$origin` and `weather$time_hour`.

![The relationship between datasets: weather and airports.](docs/relational.png){width="339"}

## Question 2

**`weather` only contains information for the three origin airports in NYC. If it contained weather records for all airports in the USA, what additional connection would it make to `flights`?**

If `weather` contained the weather records for all airports in the USA, it would have made an additional connection to the variable `dest` in the `flights` dataset.

## Question 3

**The `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, and `origin` variables almost form a compound key for `weather`, but there's one hour that has duplicate observations. Can you figure out what's special about that hour?**

As we can see in the @tbl-q3-ex2 , on November 3, 2013 at 1 am, we have a duplicate weather record. This means that the combination of `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, and `origin` variables does not form a compound key for `weather` , since some observations are not unique.

This happens because the daylight savings time clock changed on November 3, 2013 in New York City as follows: --

-   Start of DST in 2013: Sunday, March 10, 2013 -- 1 hour forward - 1 hour is skipped.

-   End of DST in 2013: Sunday, November 3, 2013 -- 1 hour backward at 1 am.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-q3-ex2
#| tbl-cap: "Day and hour that has two weather reports"

weather |>
  group_by(year, month, day, hour, origin) |>
  count() |>
  filter(n > 1) |>
  ungroup() |>
  gt() |>
  gt_theme_538()
```

## Question 4

**We know that some days of the year are special and fewer people than usual fly on them (e.g., Christmas eve and Christmas day). How might you represent that data as a data frame? What would be the primary key? How would it connect to the existing data frames?**

We can create a data frame or a tibble, as shown in the code below, named `holidays` to represent holidays and the pre-holiday days.

The primary key would be a compound key of `year` , `month` and `day`. It would connect to the existing data frames using a secondary compound key of of `year` , `month` and `day`.

*\[Note: to make things easier, without using a compound key, I have used the `make_date()` function to create a single key `flight_date()` \]*

```{r}
#| code-fold: true


# Create a tibble for the major holidays in the USA in 2013
holidays <- tibble(
  year = 2013,
  month = c(1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12),
  day = c(1, 14, 27, 4, 2, 31, 28, 25),
  holiday_name = c(
    "New Year's Day",
    "Valentine's Day",
    "Memorial Day",
    "Independence Day",
    "Labor Day",
    "Halloween",
    "Thanksgiving",
    "Christmas Day"
  ),
  holiday_type = "Holiday"
)

# Computing the pre-holiday date and adding it to holidays
holidays <- bind_rows(
  # Exisitng tibble of holidays
  holidays,
  # A new tibble of holiday eves
  holidays |>
  mutate(
    day = day-1,
    holiday_name = str_c(holiday_name, " Eve"),
    holiday_type = "Pre-Holiday"
  ) |>
  slice(2:8)
) |>
  mutate(flight_date = make_date(year, month, day))

# Display
holidays |> 
  gt() |> 
  # cols_label_with(fn = ~ make_clean_names(., case = "title")) |>
  gt_theme_nytimes()
```

Now, we can use this new tibble, join it with our existing data sets and try to figure out whether there is any difference in number of flights on holidays, and pre-holidays, vs. the rest of the days. The results are in @fig-q4-ex2-a .

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| label: fig-q4-ex2-a
#| fig-cap: "Average number of flights on holidays vs pre-holidays vs rest of the days"

# A tibble on the number of flights each day, along with whether each day 
# is holiday or not; and if yes, which holiday
nos_flights <- flights |>
  mutate(flight_date = make_date(year, month, day)) |>
  left_join(holidays) |>
  group_by(flight_date, holiday_type, holiday_name) |>
  count()

nos_flights |>
  group_by(holiday_type) |>
  summarize(avg_flights = mean(n)) |>
  mutate(holiday_type = if_else(is.na(holiday_type),
                                "Other Days",
                                holiday_type)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = avg_flights,
             y = reorder(holiday_type, avg_flights))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "grey") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank()) +
  labs(y = NULL, x = "Average Number of flights (per day)",
       title = "Holidays / pre-holiday have lower number of flights, on average") +
  theme(plot.title.position = "plot")
```

The number of flights on various holidays and pre-holiday days is shown in @fig-q4-ex2-b .

```{r}
#| label: fig-q4-ex2-b
#| fig-cap: "Average number of flights on some important days vs others"
#| code-fold: true
nos_flights |>
  group_by(holiday_name) |>
  summarize(avg_flights = mean(n)) |>
  mutate(holiday_name = if_else(is.na(holiday_name),
                                "Other Days",
                                holiday_name)) |>
  mutate(col_var = holiday_name == "Other Days") |>
  ggplot(aes(x = avg_flights,
             y = reorder(holiday_name, avg_flights),
             fill = col_var,
             label = round(avg_flights, 0))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  geom_text(nudge_x = 20, size = 3) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank(),
        plot.title.position = "plot",
        legend.position = "none") +
  labs(y = NULL, x = "Number of flights (per day)") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Paired") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(500, 1050))
```

## Question 5

**Draw a diagram illustrating the connections between the `Batting`, `People`, and `Salaries` data frames in the Lahman package. Draw another diagram that shows the relationship between `People`, `Managers`, `AwardsManagers`. How would you characterize the relationship between the `Batting`, `Pitching`, and `Fielding` data frames?**

The data-frames are shown below, alongwith the check that `playerID` is a key: --

In `Batting` , the variables `playerID` , `yearID` and `stint` form a compound key.

```{r}
library(Lahman)
Batting |> as_tibble() |>
  group_by(playerID, yearID, stint) |>
  count() |>
  filter(n > 1)
head(Batting) |> tibble() |> 
  gt() |> gt_theme_538() |>
   tab_style(
    style = list(cell_fill(color = "yellow"),
                 cell_text(weight = "bold")),
    locations = cells_body(columns = c(playerID, yearID, stint))
  ) |>
  tab_header(title = md("**`Batting`**"))
```

In `People`, the variable `playerID` is unique for each observation, and hence a primary key.

```{r}
People |> 
  as_tibble() |>
  group_by(playerID) |>
  count() |>
  filter(n > 1)

head(People) |> tibble() |> 
  gt() |> gt_theme_538() |>
   tab_style(
    style = list(cell_fill(color = "yellow"),
                 cell_text(weight = "bold")),
    locations = cells_body(columns = c(playerID))
  ) |>
  tab_header(title = md("**`People`**"))

```

In `Salaries` the variables `playerID` , `yearID` and `stint` form a compound key.

```{r}
Salaries |> 
  as_tibble() |>
  group_by(playerID, yearID, teamID) |>
  count() |>
  filter(n > 1)

head(Salaries) |> tibble() |> 
  gt() |> gt_theme_538() |>
   tab_style(
    style = list(cell_fill(color = "yellow"),
                 cell_text(weight = "bold")),
    locations = cells_body(columns = c(playerID, yearID, teamID))
  )|>
  tab_header(title = md("**`Salaries`**"))
```

The diagram illustrating the connections is shown below: --

![](docs/relation-q5-ex2-a.png){width="492"}

Now, we show another diagram that shows the relationship between `People`, `Managers`, `AwardsManagers`.

For `Managers`, the key is a compound key of `playerID`, `yearID` and `inseason`

```{r}
head(Managers)
Managers |>
  as_tibble() |>
  group_by(playerID, yearID, inseason) |>
  count() |>
  filter(n > 1)

head(Managers) |> as_tibble() |>
  gt() |> 
  gt_theme_538() |>
  tab_style(
    style = list(cell_fill(color = "yellow"),
                 cell_text(weight = "bold")),
    locations = cells_body(columns = c(playerID, yearID, inseason))
  ) |>
  tab_header(title = md("**`Managers`**"))
```

For `AwardsManagers` , the primary key is a compound key of `playerID` , `awardID` and `yearID` .

```{r}
head(AwardsManagers)

AwardsManagers |>
  as_tibble() |>
  group_by(playerID, awardID, yearID) |>
  count() |>
  filter(n > 1)

head(AwardsManagers) |> as_tibble() |>
  gt() |> 
  gt_theme_538() |>
  tab_style(
    style = list(cell_fill(color = "yellow"),
                 cell_text(weight = "bold")),
    locations = cells_body(columns = c(playerID, yearID, awardID))
  ) |>
  tab_header(title = md("**`AwardsManagers`**"))
```

Hence, the relationship between `People`, `Managers`, `AwardsManagers` is as follows: --

![](docs/relation-q5-ex2-b.png){width="506"}

Now, let's try to characterize the relationship between `Batting` , `Pitching` and `Fielding`.

```{r}
Pitching |> as_tibble() |>
  group_by(playerID, yearID, stint) |>
  count() |>
  filter(n > 1)

head(Pitching) |> as_tibble() |>
  gt() |> 
  gt_theme_538() |>
  tab_style(
    style = list(cell_fill(color = "yellow"),
                 cell_text(weight = "bold")),
    locations = cells_body(columns = c(playerID, yearID, stint))
  ) |>
  tab_header(title = md("**`Pitching`**"))
```

In the `Fielding` dataset, the primary key is a compound key comprised of `playerID` , `yearID` , `stint` and `POS`.

```{r}
Fielding |> as_tibble() |>
  group_by(playerID, yearID, stint, POS) |>
  count() |>
  filter(n > 1)

head(Fielding) |> as_tibble() |>
  gt() |> 
  gt_theme_538() |>
  tab_style(
    style = list(cell_fill(color = "yellow"),
                 cell_text(weight = "bold")),
    locations = cells_body(columns = c(playerID, yearID, stint, POS))
  ) |>
  tab_header(title = md("**`Fielding`**"))
```

Thus, the relationship between the `Batting`, `Pitching`, and `Fielding` data frames is as follows: --

# **20.3.4 Exercises**

## Question 1

**Find the 48 hours (over the course of the whole year) that have the worst delays. Cross-reference it with the `weather` data. Can you see any patterns?**

First, we find out the 48 hours (over the course of the whole year) that have the worst delays. As we can see in @fig-q1-ex3-dist , these are quite similar across the 3 origin airports, for which we have the weather data.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| label: fig-q1-ex3-dist
#| fig-cap: "Distribution of the 48 worst delay hours over the course of the year in three airports of New York City"
# Create a dataframe of 48 hours with highestaverage delays 
# (for each of the 3 origin airports)
delayhours = flights |>
  group_by(origin, time_hour) |>
  summarize(avg_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  arrange(desc(avg_delay), .by_group = TRUE) |>
  slice_head(n = 48) |>
  arrange(time_hour)

delayhours |>
  ggplot(aes(y = time_hour, x = avg_delay)) +
  geom_point(size = 2, alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~origin, dir = "h") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Average delay during the hour (in mins.)", y = NULL,
       title = "The worst 48 hours for departure delays are similar across 3 airports")
```

The @fig-q1-ex3-multi depicts that across the three airports, the 48 hours with worst delays consistently have much higher rainfall *(precipitation in inches)* and poorer visibility *(lower visibility in miles and higher dew-point in degrees F).*

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| label: fig-q1-ex3-multi
#| fig-cap: "Comparison of weather patterns for hours with worst delays vs the rest"

var_labels = c("Temperature (F)", "Dewpoint (F)",

       fill = "") 

library(patchwork)

g1 / g2 / g3 + plot_layout(guides = "collect") & theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

## Question 2

**Imagine you've found the top 10 most popular destinations using this code:**

```         
top_dest <- flights2 |>   
  count(dest, sort = TRUE) |>   
  head(10)
```

**How can you find all flights to those destinations?**

We can first create a vector of the names of the top 10 destinations, using `select(dest)` and `as_vector()` . Thereafter, we can `filter(dest %in% top_dest_vec)` as shown below: --

```{r}
flights2 <- flights |> 
  mutate(id = row_number(), .before = 1)
top_dest <- flights2 |>   
  count(dest, sort = TRUE) |>   
  head(10)
top_dest_vec <- top_dest |> select(dest) |> as_vector()
flights |>
  filter(dest %in% top_dest_vec) 
```

## Question 3

**Does every departing flight have corresponding weather data for that hour?**

No, as we can see from the code below, every departing flight DOES NOT have corresponding weather data for that hour. 1556 flights do not have associated weather data; and these correspond to 38 different hours during the year.

```{r}
# Number of flights that do not have associated weather data
flights |>
  anti_join(weather) |>
  nrow()

# Number of distinct time_hours that do not have such data
flights |>
  anti_join(weather) |>
  distinct(time_hour)

# A check to confirm our results
flights |>
  select(year, month, day, origin, dest, time_hour) |>
  left_join(weather) |>
  summarise(
    missing_temp_or_windspeed = mean(is.na(temp) & is.na(wind_speed)),
    missing_dewp = mean(is.na(dewp))
  )
(as.numeric(flights |> anti_join(weather) |> nrow())) / nrow(flights)
```

## Question 4

**What do the tail numbers that don't have a matching record in `planes` have in common? (Hint: one variable explains \~90% of the problems.)**

The tail numbers that don't have a matching record in `planes` mostly belong the a select few airline carriers, i.e., `AA` and `MQ` . The variable `carrier` explains most of the problems in missing data, as shown in @fig-q4-ex3.

```{r}
#| label: fig-q4-ex3
#| fig-cap: "Bar Chart of number of flights per carrier"
#| code-fold: true

# Create a unique flight ID for each flight
flights2 <- flights |>
  mutate(id = row_number(), .before = 1)
  
ids_no_record = flights2 |>
  anti_join(planes, by = join_by(tailnum)) |>
  select(id) |>
  as_vector() |> unname()

flights2 = flights2 |>
  mutate(
    missing_record = id %in% ids_no_record
  )

label_vec = c("Flights with missing tailnum in planes", "Other flights")
names(label_vec) = c(FALSE, TRUE)

flights2 |>
  group_by(missing_record) |>
  count(carrier) |>
  mutate(col_var = carrier %in% c("MQ", "AA")) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = n, y = carrier, fill = col_var)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  facet_wrap(~ missing_record, 
             scales = "free_x", 
             labeller = labeller(missing_record = label_vec)) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(x = "Number of flights",  y = "Carrier",
       title = "Flights with missing tailnum in planes belong to a select few carriers") + 
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2")
```

## Question 5

**Add a column to `planes` that lists every `carrier` that has flown that plane. You might expect that there's an implicit relationship between plane and airline, because each plane is flown by a single airline. Confirm or reject this hypothesis using the tools you've learned in previous chapters.**

Using the code below, we confirm that there are 17 such different airplanes (identified by `tailnum`) that have been flown by two carriers. These are shown in @fig-q5-ex3-1 .

```{r}
#| label: fig-q5-ex3-1
#| code-fold: true
#| tbl-cap: "Tail numbers which ahve been flown by more than one carrier"
#| tbl-cap-location: top


# Displaying tail numbers which have been used by more than one carriers
flights |>
  group_by(tailnum) |>
  summarise(number_of_carriers = n_distinct(carrier)) |>
  filter(number_of_carriers > 1) |>
  drop_na() |>
  gt() |>
  opt_interactive(page_size_default = 5,
                  use_highlight = TRUE, 
                  pagination_type = "simple") |>
  cols_label_with(fn = ~ janitor::make_clean_names(., case = "title"))
```

The following code adds a column to `planes` that lists every `carrier` that has flown that plane.

```{r}

# A tibble that lists all carriers a tailnum has flown
all_carrs = flights |>
  group_by(tailnum) |>
  distinct(carrier) |>
  summarise(carriers = paste0(carrier, collapse = ", ")) |>
  arrange(desc(str_length(carriers)))
# Display the tibble
slice_head(all_carrs, n= 30) |>
   gt() |> opt_interactive(page_size_default = 5)

# Merge with planes
planes |>
  left_join(all_carrs)
```

## Question 6

**Add the latitude and the longitude of the origin *and* destination airport to `flights`. Is it easier to rename the columns before or after the join?**

The code shown below adds the latitude and the longitude of the origin *and* destination airport to `flights`. As we can see, it easier to rename the columns after the join, so that we the same airport might (though not in this case) may be used as `origin` and/or `dest`. Further, the use of `rename()` after the join allows us to write the code in flow.

```{r}
flights |>
  left_join(airports, by = join_by(dest == faa)) |>
  rename(
    "dest_lat" = lat,
    "dest_lon" = lon
  ) |>
  left_join(airports, by = join_by(origin == faa)) |>
  rename(
    "origin_lat" = lat,
    "origin_lon" = lon
  ) |>
  relocate(origin, origin_lat, origin_lon,
           dest, dest_lat, dest_lon,
           .before = 1)
```

## Question 7

**Compute the average delay by destination, then join on the `airports` data frame so you can show the spatial distribution of delays. Here's an easy way to draw a map of the United States:**

```         
airports |>   
  semi_join(flights, join_by(faa == dest)) |>   
  ggplot(aes(x = lon, y = lat)) +     
  borders("state") +     
  geom_point() +     
  coord_quickmap()
```

**You might want to use the `size` or `color` of the points to display the average delay for each airport.**

The following code and the resulting @fig-map-q7-ex3 displays the result. I would like to avoid using size as an aesthetic, as it is not easy to compare on a continuous scale, and leads to visually tough comparison. Instead, I prefer to use an interactive visualization shown further below.

```{r}
#| label: fig-map-q7-ex3
#| fig-asp: 1
#| fig-cap: "Airport destinations from New York City, with average arrival delays"

# Create a dataframe of 1 row for origin airports
or_apts = airports |>
  filter(faa %in% c("EWR", "JFK", "LGA")) |>
  select(-c(alt, tz, dst, tzone)) |>
  rename(dest = faa) |>
  mutate(type = "New York City",
         avg_delay = 0)
    
# Start with the flights data-set
flights |>

  # Compute average delay for each location
  group_by(dest) |>
  summarise(avg_delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  
  # Add the latitude and longitude data
  left_join(airports, join_by(dest == faa)) |>
  select(-c(alt, tz, dst, tzone)) |>
  mutate(type = "Destinations") |>
  
  # Add a row for origin airports data
  bind_rows(or_apts) |>
 
  # Plot the map and points
  ggplot(aes(x = lon, y = lat, 
             col = avg_delay, 
             shape = type,
             label = name)) +     
  borders("state", colour = "white", fill = "lightgrey") +     
  geom_point(size = 2) +     
  coord_quickmap(xlim = c(-130, -65),
                 ylim = c(23, 50)) +
  scale_color_viridis_c(option = "C") +
  labs(col = "Average Delay at Arrival (mins.)", shape = "") +
  
  # Themes and Customization
  theme_void() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

## Question 8

**What happened on June 13 2013? Draw a map of the delays, and then use Google to cross-reference with the weather.**

In the map shown in figure @fig-map-q8-ex3 , we see abnormally large delays for all destinations than normal.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
flights |>
  mutate(Date = if_else((month == 6 & day == 13),
                       "June 13, 2013",
                       "Rest of the year")) |>
  group_by(Date) |>
  summarise(average_departure_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  gt() |>
  cols_label_with(fn = ~ janitor::make_clean_names(., case = "title")) |>
  fmt_number(columns = average_departure_delay) |>
  gt_theme_538()
```

Further, when we search the weather on internet using google, we find that a major storm system had hit New York City on June 13, 2013. Thus, the departure delays are expected. The links to the weather reports are [here](https://www.spc.noaa.gov/exper/archive/event.php?date=20130613), and [in an article on severe flight cancellations and delays](https://www.usatoday.com/story/todayinthesky/2013/06/13/severe-storms-snarl-flights-across-the-east/2418761/).

```{r}
#| label: fig-map-q8-ex3
#| fig-cap: "Flight delays on June 13, 2013 for flights originating in New York City"
#| fig-cap-location: top

# Start with the flights data-set for June 13, 2013

# **20.5.5 Exercises**

## Question 1

**Can you explain what's happening with the keys in this equi join? Why are they different?**

```         
x |> 
  full_join(y, by = "key")
#> # A tibble: 4 × 3
#>     key val_x val_y
#>   <dbl> <chr> <chr>
#> 1     1 x1    y1   
#> 2     2 x2    y2   
#> 3     3 x3    <NA> 
#> 4     4 <NA>  y3

x |> 
  full_join(y, by = "key", keep = TRUE)
#> # A tibble: 4 × 4
#>   key.x val_x key.y val_y
#>   <dbl> <chr> <dbl> <chr>
#> 1     1 x1        1 y1   
#> 2     2 x2        2 y2   
#> 3     3 x3       NA <NA> 
#> 4    NA <NA>      4 y3
```

Yes, the `key` column names in the output are different because when we use the option `keep = TRUE` in the `full_join()` function, the execution by `dplyr` retains both the keys and names them as `key.x` and `key.y` for ease of recognition.

## Question 2

**When finding if any party period overlapped with another party period we used `q < q` in the [`join_by()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/join_by.html)? Why? What happens if you remove this inequality?**

The default syntax for function `inner_join` is `inner_join(x, y, by = NULL, ...)` . The default for `by =` argument is `NULL`, where the default `*_join()⁠` will perform a natural join, using all variables in common across `x` and `y`.

Thus, when we skip `q < q` , the `inner_join` finds that the variables `q` , `start` and `end` are common. The `start` and `end` variables are taken care of by the helper function `overlaps()` . But `q` remains. Since `q` is common in `parties` and `parties` all observations get matched. To prevent observations from matching on `q` we can keep a condition `q < q` , and thus each observation and match is repeated only once, leading to correct results.

```{r}
parties <- tibble(
  q = 1:4,
  party = ymd(c("2022-01-10", "2022-04-04", "2022-07-11", "2022-10-03")),
  start = ymd(c("2022-01-01", "2022-04-04", "2022-07-11", "2022-10-03")),
  end = ymd(c("2022-04-03", "2022-07-11", "2022-10-02", "2022-12-31"))
)

# Using the correct code in textbook
parties |> 
  inner_join(parties, join_by(overlaps(start, end, start, end), q < q)) |>
  select(start.x, end.x, start.y, end.y)

# Removing the "q < q" in the join_by()
parties |> 
  inner_join(parties, join_by(overlaps(start, end, start, end))) |>
  select(start.x, end.x, start.y, end.y)
```
