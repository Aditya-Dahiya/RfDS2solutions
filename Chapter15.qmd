# **15.2.4 Exercises**

## Question 1

**Create strings that contain the following values:**

1.  `He said "That's amazing!"`

2.  `\a\b\c\d`

3.  `\\\\\\`

## Question 2

**Create the string in your R session and print it. What happens to the special "\\u00a0"? How does [`str_view()`](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/reference/str_view.html) display it? Can you do a little googling to figure out what this special character is?**

```         
x <- "This\u00a0is\u00a0tricky"
```
